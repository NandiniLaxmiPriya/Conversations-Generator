Photosynthesis is the physicochemical process by which green plants, algae, and some
bacteria synthesise organic compounds in the presence of sunlight using components such
as carbon dioxide and water. In this process, light energy is converted to chemical energy in
the form of sugars and Oxygen as a byproduct.
