A distributed system is one in which components residing on computers connected to a network coordinate their actions by only sending messages.

A distributed system is one in which hardware or software components residing on computers connected to a network coordinate their actions by only sending messages.

Computers connected via a network may be spatially separated by any distance.  They may be on different continents, in the same building, or in the same room.

Characteristics of distributed systems: component synchronization, lack of global clock, and independent component failures.

Synchronization: In a network of computers, concurrent program execution is common. You can do your work on your computer while I do my work on mine, sharing resources such as web pages or files as needed. The capacity of the system to manage its shared resources can be increased by adding additional resources.

No Global Clock - Computers on a network can synchronize their clocks - there is no single global notion of correct time. This is a direct consequence of the fact that communication is solely by sending messages over the network.

Independent Failures: Each component of the system can fail independently, with the remainder continuing to operate.

Examples of Distributed Systems
The Internet

The modern Internet is a vast, interconnected collection of many different kinds of computer networks, the range of types is ever increasing, and now includes a wide range of wireless communication technologies such as WiFi, WiMAX, Bluetooth, and third-generation mobile phone networks. As a result, networking has become a ubiquitous resource, and devices can be connected (if needed) anytime and anywhere.

• Shows a typical component of the Internet.
• Programs running on computers connected to it interact by sending messages,
• The Internet is also a very large distributed system.
• It allows users, wherever they are, to use services such as the World Wide Web, email, and file transfer.
• The set of services is open-ended
• It can be extended by adding server computers and new kinds of services.
• This figure shows a collection of intranets – subnetworks maintained by companies and other organizations and usually protected by firewalls. The role of a firewall is to protect the intranet by preventing unauthorized messages from getting out or getting in.
• Internet Service Providers (ISPs) are companies that provide broadband links and other kinds of connections to individual users and small organizations, allowing access to services anywhere on the Internet, and providing local services such as email and web hosting.
• Intranets are interconnected by backbones.
• A backbone is a network link with high transmission capacity, using satellite connections, fiber-optic cables, and other high-bandwidth circuits.

Intranet

A separately administered part of the Internet and has a boundary that can be configured to enforce local security policies.

Consists of a number of LANs interconnected by backbone connections.

Is connected to the Internet via a router.

Major issues in the design of components for use in an intranet
• File services
• Firewall
• Software installation and support costs

Mobile and Ubiquitous Computing

Miniaturization of devices and advances in wireless networking have led to the incorporation of large numbers of small and portable computing devices into distributed systems.

These devices include:

• Laptop computers.
• Handheld devices including mobile phones, smartphones, GPS-enabled devices, pagers, Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs), video cameras, and digital cameras.
• Wearable devices such as smartwatches, which have functionality similar to a PDA.
• Devices embedded in appliances such as washing machines, hi-fi systems, cars, and refrigerators.
• The portability of many of these devices, coupled with their ability to conveniently connect to networks in different locations, makes mobile computing possible.
• Mobile computing means carrying out computing tasks while the user is traveling or visiting locations other than their usual environment.
• In mobile computing, users away from their ‘home’ intranet (the intranet at work or in their residence) are provided with access to resources through the devices they carry.
• They can continue to access the Internet; they can continue to access resources on their home intranet; and there is an increasing provision for users to use resources such as printers or points of sale as they move around. This is also called location-aware or context-aware computing.
• Mobility introduces several challenges for distributed systems, the need to cope with variable connectivity and indeed disconnection, and the need to maintain operation in the face of device mobility.
• Ubiquitous computing is the use of very small, cheap computing devices in users’ physical environments, including home, office, and natural settings.
• The word ‘ubiquitous’ is intended to suggest that small computing devices will eventually become so pervasive in everyday objects that they are rarely noticed. That is, their computing behavior is transparently and intimately intertwined with their physical function.
• Computers everywhere only become useful when they can communicate with each other. For example, users might find it convenient to control their washing machine or their entertainment system from their phone or from a ‘universal remote control’ device in their home. Similarly, the washing machine might notify the user via a smart badge or phone when the wash is complete.
• Ubiquitous and mobile computing overlap because mobile users can benefit from computers everywhere. But they are generally distinct.
• Ubiquitous computing benefits users while they are in a single environment, such as a home or hospital. Similarly, mobile computing has advantages even if it only involves traditional, separate computers and devices such as laptops and printers.
• Shows a user visiting a host organization. This figure shows the user’s home intranet and the host intranet at the site the user is visiting. Both intranets are connected to the rest of the Internet. The user has access to three forms of wireless connection. Their laptop has a way of connecting to the host’s wireless LAN. This network provides coverage of a few hundred meters (a floor of a building, say). It connects to the rest of the host intranet through a gateway or access point. The user also has a mobile (cellular) phone, which is connected to the Internet. The phone gives access to the web and other Internet services, controlled only by what is displayed on its small display, and can also provide location information via a built-in GPS function. Finally, the user carries a digital camera, which can communicate with a device such as a printer via a personal area wireless network (up to about 10 meters).
