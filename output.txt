Photosynthesis is the physicochemical process by which green plants, algae, and some 
bacteria synthesise organic compounds in the presence of sunlight using components such 
as carbon dioxide and water. In this process, light energy is converted to chemical energy in 
the form of sugars and Oxygen as a byproduct.
