Photosynthesis is the physicochemical process by which green plants, algae, and some
bacteria synthesise organic compounds in the presence of sunlight using components such
as carbon dioxide and water. In this process, light energy is converted to chemical energy in
the form of sugars and Oxygen as a byproduct.

The image is a diagram of a chloroplast showing the different parts of the chloroplast and the process of photosynthesis.  Key features include labels for the thylakoid, stroma, granum, lamella, and other components.  Arrows show the movement of H+ ions.  The diagram also includes labels indicating pH levels in different parts of the chloroplast.
