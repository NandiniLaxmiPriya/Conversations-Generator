Photosynthesis is the physicochemical process by which green plants, algae, and some bacteria synthesize organic compounds using components such as carbon dioxide and water in the presence of sunlight.
In this process, light energy is converted into chemical energy in the form of sugar and oxygen.
The process of converting light energy into chemical energy.
During photosynthesis in green plants, light energy is captured and used to convert water, carbon dioxide, and minerals into oxygen and energy-rich organic compounds.
It is impossible to overestimate the importance of photosynthesis in maintaining life on Earth.
If photosynthesis is stopped, soon there will be little food or other organic matter on Earth.
Many organisms disappear, and over time the Earth's atmosphere becomes almost gaseous without oxygen.
The only organisms that exist under such conditions are chemosynthetic bacteria, which can use the chemical energy of certain inorganic compounds and therefore do not depend on the conversion of light energy.
The energy produced by photosynthesis of plants millions of years ago is responsible for the fossil fuels (i.e. coal, oil and gas) that power industrial society.
In past ages, the green plants and small creatures that feed on plants have grown faster than they consume them, and their remains have been stored in the Earth's crust by relaxation and other geological processes.
These organic residues, protected from oxidation, were gradually converted into fossil fuels.
These fuels are not only a major source of energy consumed in factories, homes and transport sectors but also serve as raw materials for plastics and other synthetic products.
Unfortunately, modern civilization is consuming an extra photosynthetic product that has been collected over millions of years in a few centuries.
As a result, carbon dioxide removed from the air is recovered very quickly to make carbon hydrates in light synthesis for millions of years.
The concentration of carbon dioxide in the Earth's atmosphere is increasing at an unprecedented rate in Earth's history, and the phenomenon is expected to have major impacts on Earth's atmosphere.
In a world of rapidly growing human population, the demand for food, materials and energy has created a need to increase the amount of photosynthesis and the capacity to convert photosynthetic production into useful products for people.
In response to those needs - the so-called Green Revolution, which began in the mid-20th century - vast improvements in agricultural yields were achieved through the control of chemical fertilizers, pesticides and plant diseases, plant breeding, and the use of machine farming, crop and crop processing.
This effort has limited severe hunger in some parts of the world despite rapid population growth, but has not eliminated widespread undernutrition.
Moreover, the rate of decline in the growth of the yield of the major crops has started since the early 1990s.
This is especially true in rice in Asia.
The continuous development of new plant varieties and the ever-increasing cost of fertilisers, pesticides and the constant development of new plant varieties has become a problem for farmers in many countries due to the continuous increase in agricultural production.
