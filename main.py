You will receive the PDF, which may contain English or Telugu text. \n
Your task is to extract the complete textual content exactly as it appears in the PDF but You should not extract text from images, tables and figures. Preserving the original language of each segment.\n
You should extract the bullets and also extract the content for each bullet correctly. \n
Strictly ignore page numbers, headers, footers, borders and any other elements that are not the main textual content of the document.\n
Maintain the original order of the text as it appears across all pages of the PDF. Do not rephrase or interpret the content; output the text verbatim. Pay attention to the sequence of paragraphs and sentences within each page.\n
Preserve the original line breaks within paragraphs and sentences as much as possible, unless they are clearly artifacts of page layout rather than sentence breaks. Maintain the original spacing between words.\n
The output should be a single, continuous string of text representing the content of the entire PDF, maintaining the original order of pages and the flow of text within each page.\n
Do not summarize, paraphrase, translate, or add any commentary to the extracted text. Your sole purpose is to provide the exact text as it exists in the PDF.\n"""
